# User Story Format

## Context and Problem Statement

# Status
Accepted

## Context
Stakeholder's and Development staff need a standardised way of proposing system functionality for the AFS System. This is due to the need for all stakeholders and developers to be able to easily understand proposed functionality, see the scope of the work involved, accurately estimate the time it will take to develop each section of the system and easily plan the development cycle.

## Considered Options

* Agile Methodology User Stories
* Epic's

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Agile Methodology User Stories", because this will allow developers and stakeholders to have discussions about the features and functionality rather than talking through requirements

### Positive Consequences

* Allowing User's and Stakeholders to have a format that is easily readable
* Allows User's and Stakeholders to more easily estimate

### Negative Consequences

* User Stories not in this format will be rejected
